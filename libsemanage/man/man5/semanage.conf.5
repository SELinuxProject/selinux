.SH NAME
semanage.conf \- global configuration file for the SELinux Management library
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR semanage.conf
file is usually located under the directory /etc/selinux and it is used for run-time configuration of the
behavior of the SELinux Management library.

.PP
Each line should contain a configuration parameter followed by the equal sign ("=") and then followed by the configuration value for that
parameter. Anything after the "#" symbol is ignored similarly to empty lines.

.PP
The following parameters are allowed:

.RS
.TP
.B module-store
Specify how the SELinux Management library should interact with the SELinux policy store. When set to "direct", the SELinux
Management library writes to the SELinux policy module store directly (this is the default setting).
Otherwise a socket path or a server name can be used for the argument.
If the argument begins with "/" (as in "/foo/bar"), it represents the path to a named socket that should be used to connect the policy management
server.
If the argument does not begin with a "/" (as in "example.com:4242"), it should be interpreted as the name of a remote policy management server
to be used through a TCP connection (default port is 4242 unless a different one is specified after the server name using the colon to separate
the two fields).

.TP
.B root
Specify an alternative root path to use for the store. The default is "/"

.TP
.B store-root
Specify an alternative store_root path to use. The default is "/var/lib/selinux"

.TP
.B compiler-directory
Specify an alternative directory that contains HLL to CIL compilers. The default value is "/usr/libexec/selinux/hll".

.TP
.B ignore-module-cache
Whether or not to ignore the cache of CIL modules compiled from HLL. It can be set to either "true" or "false" and is set to "false" by default.
If the cache is ignored, then all CIL modules are recompiled from their HLL modules.

.TP
.B policy-version
When generating the policy, by default
.BR semanage
will set the policy version to POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX, as defined in <sepol/policydb/policydb.h>. Change this setting if a different
version needs to be set for the policy.

.TP
.B target-platform
The target platform to generate policies for. Valid values are "selinux" and "xen", and is set to "selinux" by default.

.TP
.B expand-check
Whether or not to check "neverallow" rules when executing all
.BR semanage
command. It can be set to either "0" (disabled) or "1" (enabled) and by default it is enabled. There might be a large
penalty in execution time if this option is enabled.

.TP
.B file-mode
By default the permission mode for the run-time policy files is set to 0644.

.TP
.B save-previous
It controls whether the previous module directory is saved after a successful commit to the policy store and it can be set to
either "true" or "false". By default it is set to "false" (the previous version is deleted).

.TP
.B save-linked
It controls whether the previously linked module is saved (with name "base.linked") after a successful commit to the policy store.
It can be set to either "true" or "false" and by default it is set to "false" (the previous module is deleted).

.TP
.B ignoredirs
List, separated by ";",  of directories to ignore when setting up users homedirs.
Some distributions use this to stop labeling /root as a homedir.

.TP
.B usepasswd
Whether or not to enable the use getpwent() to obtain a list of home directories to label. It can be set to either "true" or "false".
By default it is set to "true".

.TP
.B disable-genhomedircon
It controls whether or not the genhomedircon function is executed when using the
.BR semanage
command and it can be set to either "false" or "true". By default the genhomedircon functionality is enabled (equivalent
to this option set to "false").

.TP
.B handle-unknown
This option overrides the kernel behavior for handling permissions defined in the kernel but missing from the actual policy.
It can be set to "deny", "reject" or "allow". By default the setting from the policy is taken.

.TP
.B bzip-blocksize
It should be in the range 0-9. A value of 0 means no compression. By default the bzip block size is set to 9 (actual block
size value is obtained after multiplication by 100000).

.TP
.B bzip-small
When set to "true", the bzip algorithm shall try to reduce its system memory usage. It can be set to either "true" or "false" and
by default it is set to "false".

.TP
.B remove-hll
When set to "true", HLL files will be removed after compilation into CIL. In order to delete HLL files already compiled into CIL,
modules will need to be recompiled with the
.BR ignore-module-cache
option set to 'true' or using the
.BR ignore-module-cache
option with semodule. The remove-hll option can be set to either "true" or "false"
and by default it is set to "false".

Please note that since this option deletes all HLL files, an updated HLL compiler will not be able to recompile the original HLL file into CIL.
In order to compile the original HLL file into CIL, the same HLL file will need to be reinstalled.

.TP
.B optimize-policy
When set to "true", the kernel policy will be optimized upon rebuilds.
It can be set to either "true" or "false" and by default it is set to "true".

.TP
.B multiple-decls
When set to "true", duplicate type, type attribute, and role declarations will be allowed.
It can be set to either "true" or "false" and by default it is set to "true".

.RE
.PP
For certain tasks the SELinux Management library resorts to running
external commands.  For the following commands their path and arguments can
be overridden:

.RS
.RS
.TP
.B load_policy
Command to load a kernel policy.
Requires no argument.
Defaults to
.IR /sbin/load_policy
with no arguments.

.TP
.B setfiles
Command to verify file context definitions.
Requires two arguments, the path to the kernel policy and the path to the
file context definition file.
Defaults to
.IR /sbin/setfiles
with the arguments '\-q \-c $@ $<'.

.TP
.B sefcontext_compile
Command to compile a file context definition file.
Requires one argument, the path to the to be compiled file context
definition file.
Defaults to
.IR /sbin/sefcontext_compile
with the argument '$@'.

.RE
.PP
Either
.IR path
or
.IR args
can be omitted.
The argument string must contain '$@' for the first required argument,
and '$<' for the second one.
The syntax for overriding an external command property is:

.RS

[\fIname\fR]
.sp 0
path = /path/to/command
.sp 0
args = --flag
.sp 0
[end]

.RE

.TP
Example

.RS

[sefcontext_compile]
.sp 0
path = /usr/sbin/sefcontext_compile
.sp 0
args = -r $@
.sp 0
[end]

.RE
.PP
Optionally the SELinux Management library can invoke external commands to
verify source modules (\fBverify module\fR), linked modules
(\fBverify linked\fR), and kernel policies (\fBverify kernel\fR).
The syntax is identical to the above command overrides.
The program should exit with a value of 0 on success, and non zero on
failure.
