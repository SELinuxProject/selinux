# Contributing to SELinux

Contributing to the SELinux userspace project is a similar process to
other open source projects. Bug reports, new features to the existing
code, additional tools, or updated documentation are all welcome.

You can find a list of open issues where you might contribute to the SELinux kernel code at
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-kernel/issues or to the SELinux userspace code at
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/issues.

See the selinuxproject.org [user resources
page](http://selinuxproject.org/page/User_Resources) for more
information on mailing lists, documentation, and other resources.

## Reporting Bugs

All bugs and patches should be submitted to the [SELinux mailing
list](https://lore.kernel.org/selinux) at selinux@vger.kernel.org.

When reporting bugs please include versions of SELinux related libraries and
tools (libsepol, libselinux, libsemanage, checkpolicy). If you are
using a custom policy please include it as well.

## Compiling

See README.md for instructions on how to compile and test this project.

## Contributing Code

After obtaining the code of the repository (see below), create a patch
against the repository, and post that patch to the [SELinux mailing
list](https://lore.kernel.org/selinux) at selinux@vger.kernel.org. When preparing
patches, please follow these guidelines:

-   Patches should apply with -p1
-   Must apply against HEAD of the master branch
-   Separate large patches into logical patches
-   Patch descriptions must end with your "Signed-off-by" line. This means your
    code meets the Developer's certificate of origin, see below.

When adding new, large features or tools it is best to discuss the
design on the mailing list prior to submitting the patch.

## Development Repository

Git is a modern source code management system. For more information
about Git please see the Git website.

To get an anonymous checkout of the SELinux userland repository you can
run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux.git
