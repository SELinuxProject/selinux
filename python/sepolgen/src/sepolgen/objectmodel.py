#Information Flow
#
# All of the permissions in SELinux can be described in terms of
# information flow. For example, a read of a file is a flow of
# information from that file to the process reading. Viewing
# permissions in these terms can be used to model a variety of
# security properties.
#
# Here we have some infrastructure for understanding permissions
# in terms of information flow
#
#::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# Information flow deals with information either flowing from a subject
# to and object ("write") or to a subject from an object ("read"). Read
# or write is described from the subject point-of-view. It is also possible
# for a permission to represent both a read and write (though the flow is
# typical asymmetric in terms of bandwidth). It is also possible for
# permission to not flow information (meaning that the result is pure
# side-effect).
#
# The following constants are for representing the directionality
# of information flow.
