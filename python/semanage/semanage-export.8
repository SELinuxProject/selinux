.B semanage export [\-h] [\-S STORE] [\-f OUTPUT_FILE]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
semanage is used to configure certain elements of
SELinux policy without requiring modification to or recompilation
from policy sources.
.B semanage import
and
.B export
can be used to extract the SELinux modifications from one machine and apply them to another. Please note that this will remove all current semanage customizations on the second machine as the command list generated using
