semanage\-fcontext \- SELinux Policy Management file context tool

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B semanage fcontext [\-h] [\-n] [\-N] [\-S STORE] [ \-\-add ( \-t TYPE \-f FTYPE \-r RANGE \-s SEUSER | \-e TARGET_PATH ) FILE_SPEC | \-\-delete ( \-t TYPE \-f FTYPE | \-e TARGET_PATH ) FILE_SPEC | \-\-deleteall  | \-\-extract  | \-\-list [\-C] | \-\-modify ( \-t TYPE \-f FTYPE \-r RANGE \-s SEUSER | \-e TARGET_PATH ) FILE_SPEC ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
semanage is used to configure certain elements of
SELinux policy without requiring modification to or recompilation
from policy sources.
.B semanage fcontext
is used to manage the default file system labeling on an SELinux system.
This command maps file paths using regular expressions to SELinux labels.

FILE_SPEC may contain either a fully qualified path,
or a Perl compatible regular expression (PCRE),
describing fully qualified path(s). The only PCRE flag in use is PCRE2_DOTALL,
which causes a wildcard '.' to match anything, including a new line.
Strings representing paths are processed as bytes (as opposed to Unicode),
meaning that non-ASCII characters are not matched by a single wildcard.

Note, that file context definitions specified using 'semanage fcontext'
(i.e. local file context modifications stored in file_contexts.local)
have higher priority than those specified in policy modules.
This means that whenever a match for given file path is found in
file_contexts.local, no other file context definitions are considered.
Entries in file_contexts.local are processed from most recent one to the oldest,
with first match being used (as opposed to the most specific match,
which is used when matching other file context definitions).
All regular expressions should therefore be as specific as possible,
to avoid unintentionally impacting other parts of the filesystem.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.I  \-h, \-\-help
Show this help message and exit
.TP
.I   \-n, \-\-noheading
Do not print heading when listing the specified object type
.TP
.I   \-N, \-\-noreload
Do not reload policy after commit
.TP
.I   \-C, \-\-locallist
List local customizations
.TP
.I   \-S STORE, \-\-store STORE
Select an alternate SELinux Policy Store to manage
.TP
.I   \-a, \-\-add
Add a record of the specified object type
.TP
.I   \-d, \-\-delete
Delete a record of the specified object type
.TP
.I   \-m, \-\-modify
Modify a record of the specified object type
.TP
.I   \-l, \-\-list
List records of the specified object type
.TP
.I   \-E, \-\-extract
Extract customizable commands, for use within a transaction
.TP
.I   \-D, \-\-deleteall
Remove all local customizations
.TP
.I   \-e TARGET_PATH, \-\-equal TARGET_PATH
Substitute FILE_SPEC with TARGET_PATH for file label lookup. This is used with fcontext. Requires source and target path arguments to be path prefixes and does not support regular expressions. The context labeling for the target subtree is made equivalent to that defined for the source.
.TP
.I   \-f [{a,f,d,c,b,s,l,p}], \-\-ftype [{a,f,d,c,b,s,l,p}]
File Type. This is used with fcontext. Requires a file type as shown in the mode field by ls, e.g. use 'd' to match only directories or 'f' to match only regular files. The following file type options can be passed: f (regular file),d (directory),c (character device), b (block device),s (socket),l (symbolic link),p (named pipe).  If you do not specify a file type, the file type will default to "all files".

.TP
.I   \-s SEUSER, \-\-seuser SEUSER
SELinux user name
.TP
.I   \-t TYPE, \-\-type TYPE
SELinux Type for the object
.TP
.I   \-r RANGE, \-\-range RANGE
MLS/MCS Security Range (MLS/MCS Systems only) SELinux Range for SELinux login mapping defaults to the SELinux user record range. SELinux Range for SELinux user defaults to s0.

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
.I Remember to run restorecon after you set the file context
Add file-context httpd_sys_content_t for everything under /web
# semanage fcontext \-a \-t httpd_sys_content_t "/web(/.*)?"
# restorecon \-R \-v /web

Substitute /home1 with /home when setting file context
i.e. label everything under /home1 the same way /home is labeled
# semanage fcontext \-a \-e /home /home1
# restorecon \-R \-v /home1

For home directories under top level directory, for example /disk6/home,
execute the following commands.
# semanage fcontext \-a \-t home_root_t "/disk6"
# semanage fcontext \-a \-e /home /disk6/home
# restorecon \-R \-v /disk6
